# After a lot of searching around, eventually found:
#  https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-core/releases/1.9.0/docs/tagset-reference.html
# Which listed all the 'fr' tags in question in a helpful way to interpret them
# It explicitly named the extra ones used by Stanford's CoreNLP
#
# As a top-up to those in the Google Universal POS mapping, we therefore need:

# From empirical testing, also found

# Appendix: Notes on trying to figure out what POS tag set Stanford CoreNLP was using
####
#
#
# From the code:

# The Stanford FAQ:
#  https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/pos-tagger-faq.html
# lists French Treebank (FTB)
# And links to:
#   http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/Gens/Abeille/French-Treebank-fr.php

# Empirically running it, throws up many tags which could be extended variants
# This led to searching to searching Google for:
#  "French Treeback" VIMP
# which gave:
#   https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=EEq6BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA228&lpg=PA228&dq=VIMP+CLO+CLS&source=bl&ots=KZDLDdC_p7&sig=ACfU3U3XY4S8Pz4ojd419A7-nQdONGle1w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjqnZrD_vvoAhVSxzgGHa-9DqcQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=VIMP%20CLO%20CLS&f=false

# The Stanford code itself has:
#   https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP/blob/master/src/edu/stanford/nlp/trees/international/french/DybroFrenchHeadFinder.java
# Which talks about CC Tagset + 'expansion'
#
# For a page on French CC tagset, see

# The linguist tool MElt (Crabb√© & Candito, 2008) is based on CC taget
